# Using video game data to predict userâ€™s ratings of video games

I was interested in predicting how users would rate a video game based on the user score. Video games have become a big busniess that are projected to be worth an estimated $215 billion in 2018. To find data about video games and their user scores, I scrapped Steam and Steamspy. I also grabbed a video games dataset from Kaggle to boost my analysis.
